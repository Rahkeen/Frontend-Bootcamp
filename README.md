# Frontend-Bootcamp

This is my attempt at learning how to better design web applications (and just in general).

To add some structure, I will be using these resources as a general guide:

- [Free Code Camp](www.freecodecamp.com)
- [Jonathan White's Medium Articles](https://medium.com/@JonathanZWhite)
	- (Seriously, this guy's content is awesome)

I will be doing a lot of my experiments using [Codepen](www.codepen.io) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).

Lastly I will post any resources I find along the way that I find useful.
